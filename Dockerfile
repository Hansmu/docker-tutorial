# it's one of the main ways to set container keys and values for container building.

# This section is executing shell commands inside of the container as it's building it. You'd generally see run
# commands when you need to install software with a package repository, some unzipping or some file edits etc inside
# the container itself. The double ampersand is used to chain commands and it ensures that all of the commands end up
# within the same layer. Saves time and space.
